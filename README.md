# TechIT 2 - Server

TechIT 2 is a rewrite of the work order system
[TechIT](https://github.com/cysun/techit) developed by Brandon Ung, Minh Ha,
Duc Le, Kevin Castillo, and Marjorie Zelaya as their senior design project at
Cal State LA. In this rewrite we split the system into a backend that provides
a REST API and a SPA frontend.

This repository hosts the backend implemented in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
